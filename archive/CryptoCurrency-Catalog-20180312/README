SYNOPSIS

     my $record = $cat->by_code("ETH");          # => { code=>"ETH", name=>"Ethereum", safename=>"ethereum" }
     my $record = $cat->by_ticker("eth");        # alias for by_code(), lowercase also works

     my $record = $cat->by_safename("ethereum");
     my $record = $cat->by_slug("Ethereum");     # alias for by_safename(), mixed case also works

DESCRIPTION
    This class attempts to provide a list/catalog of cryptocurrencies. The
    main source for this catalog is the Cryptocurrency Market
    Capitalizations website (<https://coinmarketcap.com/>, or CMC for
    short).

    CMC does not provide unique codes nor unique names, only unique
    "safenames" (slugs). Whenever there is a clash, this catalog modifies
    the clashing code and/or unique name to make code and name to be unique
    again (usually the coin/token with the smaller market cap "loses" the
    name).

    There is no guarantee that the code/name/safename of old/unlisted coins
    or tokens will not be reused.

  by_ticker
    Alias for "by_code".
