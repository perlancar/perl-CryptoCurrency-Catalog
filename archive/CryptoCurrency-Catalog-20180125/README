SYNOPSIS
     use CryptoCurrency::Catalog;

     my $cat = CryptoCurrency::Catalog->new;

     my $record = $cat->by_symbol("ETH");        # => { symbol => "ETH", name=>"Ethereum", safename=>"ethereum" }
     my $record = $cat->by_ticker("eth");        # alias for by_symbol(), lowercase also works
     my $record = $cat->by_name("Ethereum");     # note: case-sensitive
     my $record = $cat->by_safename("ethereum");
     my $record = $cat->by_slug("Ethereum");     # alias for by_safename(), mixed case also works

     my @symbols = $cat->all_symbols(); # => ("BTC", "ETH", ...)

     my @data = $cat->all_data; # => ({symbol=>"BTC", name=>"Bitcoin", safename=>"bitcoin"}, {...}, ...)

DESCRIPTION
    This class attempts to provide a list/catalog of cryptocurrencies. The
    main source for this catalog is the Cryptocurrency Market
    Capitalizations website (<https://coinmarketcap.com/>, or CMC for
    short).

    CMC does not provide unique symbols nor unique names, only unique
    "safenames" (slugs). Whenever there is a clash, this catalog modifies
    the clashing symbol and/or unique name to make symbol and name to be
    unique again (usually the coin/token with the smaller market cap "loses"
    the name).

    There is no guarantee that the symbol/name/safename of old/unlisted
    coins or tokens will not be reused.

  by_ticker
    Alias for "by_symbol".
